Check If It Is a Straight Line
You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. 
Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

Example 1:
Input: coordinates = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: coordinates = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]]
Output: false
 

Constraints:
2 <= coordinates.length <= 1000
coordinates[i].length == 2
-10^4 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^4
Coordinates contains no duplicate point.

Hints:
If there're only 2 points, return true.
Check if all other points lie on the line defined by the first 2 points.
Use cross product to check collinearity.
